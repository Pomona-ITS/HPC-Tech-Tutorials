# This is the place for RStudio ecosystem.

There are two RStudio servers (both are VMs hosted on Pomona College VMWare infrastructure)


production server is 

http://rstudio2.campus.pomona.edu/ for access on Pomona college network 

or http://rstudio2.pomona.edu/ for access anywhere else - other campuses or home/Internet

dev server is currently down because of VMWare capacity issues, there is a ticket in FootPrints to bring it back.
