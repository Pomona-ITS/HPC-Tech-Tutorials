# POM-ITB-CHEM2

This system is currently being used by Hussein Faara, Dan O'Leary's research student. His username is hfaa2017. Had to add him to the AD group "chemistry sg" to enable access to Gaussian software.

Had to copy Dan's [.bashrc](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/systems/POM-ITB-CHEM1/files/.bashrc) to enable paths for Gaussian.
