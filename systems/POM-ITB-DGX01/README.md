# This is the page for documenting the DGX workstation set up

It is a standalone NVIDIA-made PROPRIETARY workstation with 4 V100 (Volta) cards and Ubuntu for the OS of choice. The OS is not supposed to be modified/reinstalled (other than security patches and vendor-recommended updates). Anythign non-NVIDIA-approved would invalidate the warranty/support. The workstation comes pre-loaded with all kinds of AI and generally research-oriented software and opens access to other NVIDIA AI users and the resources they share. The workstation will be joined to the HPC cluster via a scheduler queue, most likely interactive at first. One of the first users is Joe Osborn who will be teaching an AI course and is conducting associated research.

NVIDIA also makes a DGX-1 and a DGX-2 and has a number of storage vendor partnerships including Pure Storage and Cisco to scale beyond a single physical system.

Here are the pictures of the front and back when it first arrived, and the serial number/model:

Had to remove some packaging from inside, there was a sticker on the power button.


There is a power button next to the power cable before the front button can be used.


Stephen Hurtado helped out with the temporary monitor and keyboard/mouse. I will have to acuire something more permanent once we find the space for this monster in the data center.


The workstation came with 3 display-to-hdmi adapters:
