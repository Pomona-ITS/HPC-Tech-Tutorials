# This is the page for documenting the DGX workstation set up

It is a standalone NVIDIA-made PROPRIETARY workstation with 4 V100 (Volta) cards and Ubuntu for the OS of choice. The OS is not supposed to be modified/reinstalled (other than security patches and vendor-recommended updates). Anythign non-NVIDIA-approved would invalidate the warranty/support. The workstation comes pre-loaded with all kinds of AI and generally research-oriented software and opens access to other NVIDIA AI users and the resources they share. The workstation will be joined to the HPC cluster via a scheduler queue, most likely interactive at first. One of the first users is Joe Osborn who will be teaching an AI course and is conducting associated research.

NVIDIA also makes a DGX-1 and a DGX-2 and has a number of storage vendor partnerships including Pure Storage and Cisco to scale beyond a single physical system.
