H1!This is a place for describing the R infrastructure and setup in HPC.


Currently there is an RStudio prod and dev instance.

* The dev instance seems to have been powered off? Need to check with Pat.

The prod server is https://rstudio.campus.pomona.edu

The dev server is https://rstudio-dev.campus.pomona.edu (?)

Current R version on prod: 3.4.1

Current RStudio version on prod: 3.4.1

The process for R package install is currently this script. 

The work to Ansibilize this is in progress. 
When this is complete the process of adding/modifying packages should be much simplified.
