# This is a page to describe RStudio application and its use at Pomona

https://www.rstudio.com/ is the offical web site.

RStudio is basically a GUI (Installable on Mac/Windows/Linux) version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) which is a comman-line version.

Generally anything you can do in R you can do in RStudio and vice versa except the command line version of R may be better
(more performant) for really large datasets. Rstudio makes the package management, visualization and debugging easier, it also 
saves your command history and allows you to re-run your simulations in a more organized way.

There is a Desktop and a Server version of RStudio. 

It would make sense to use the Server version if you don't want to wait for the computation to finish on your laptop, and
if you want to make it more portable and shareable. Pomona College hosts an RStudio server. The links are below:

On campus: https://rstudio.campus.pomona.edu
Off campus: https://rstudio.pomona.edu

There is also Shiny which is a web interface that allows you to create mini websites with R markup language that can be
published to tell your data story or for actual papers/publications/books.

We are using the free version of both Desktop and Server. If we ever needed the Enterprise features or commercial support we 
could consider investing in paid versions described below:

To keep up with the latest trends and learn more about the use cases one can follow the conferences like

[RStudio Conference](https://www.rstudio.com/conference/)

[EARL](https://earlconf.com/)

The Enterprise Applications of the R Language Conference (EARL) is a cross-sector conference focusing on the commercial use of the R programming language. The conference is dedicated to the real-world usage of R with some of the worldâ€™s leading practitioners. Plus, networking opportunities provide an opportunity to network with speakers and fellow delegates.

Majority of the conferences share the presentations in the form of slides or even videos for free.
