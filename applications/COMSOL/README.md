# This is the page describing COMSOL-related activities


So far COMSOL is only known to be used in Geology ([Eric Grosfils](http://research.pomona.edu/eric-grosfils/publications/)).


This is the history of our communications and the notes from testing and research that was done:


Eric sent the following files to us on January 3rd 2018:

"Todd and Asya,
 
Thanks for the chat this morning! Here are some of the resources I said I’d send along…
 
-- the [2007 paper](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/applications/COMSOL/2007%20JVGR%20Grosfils.pdf) introduces the simple elastic problem we began with. We added a lot of bells and whistles subsequently, but this one lays out the methods etc fairly cleanly.
-- the [2015 paper](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/applications/COMSOL/2015%20GSLSP%20Grosfils%20et%20al%20Elastic%20models%20of%20magma%20reservoir%20mechanics.pdf) summarizes a lot of the work we did from about 2005-2015 or so; written for a more focused volcanology audience, but should give you a sense for the range of things we’ve been doing
-- I won’t send you the viscoelastic papers and elastoplastic/analogue comparisons for the most recent caldera-focused work, but if you want to see that let me know
 
-- I have attached two sets of guidelines used in class… the [Day 2 Lab 12 PDF](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/applications/COMSOL/Day%202%20Lab%2012%20COMSOL%20Inflation%20and%20failure.pdf) write-up is the students’ first introduction to COMSOL (I do a follow-up exercise with them that tests the failure idea; the Day 3 files attached are the ones there… some [brief text](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/applications/COMSOL/Day%203%20Case%20Study.docx), a [Ppt file](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/applications/COMSOL/Day%203%20Inflation%20and%20Unrest%20Case%20Study.pptx) I work through with them, and a starting [COMSOL model *.mph](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/applications/COMSOL/Day%203%202015%20Test.mph)), and the [Day 2 Thermal Modeling PDF](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/applications/COMSOL/Day%202%20Thermal%20Modeling%20in%20COMSOL.pdf) is the guts of the material from the subsequent week when the students work on a time-dependent model.
 
-- Finally, I have attached the [Hirsch Grant proposal](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/applications/COMSOL/HIRSCH%20GRANT%20APPLICATION.pdf) I submitted that received funding. That project did not commence in S2017 as hoped, so remains on my plate for this spring and coming summer if all goes well. This implementation might make a fun way to test how my local workstation compares with the HPC capabilities if we can get COMSOL interacting with the latter productively.
 
I’ll send a separate email e-introducing you to my local COMSOL contact, she’d be the place to start with respect to the parallelization process’ needs…
 
Cheers!
 
Eric
