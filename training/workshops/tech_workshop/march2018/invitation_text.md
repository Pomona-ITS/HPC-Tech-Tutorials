# Invitation text

Slack URL for general announcements and questions: https://pomonaits.slack.com/messages/C8DTZN5GW (If you cannot get in send me an email and I will add you)

Please forward to all that you think should attend or let me know and will include them. So far, I included everyone who I have talked to about this initiative, and I am relying on you to extend the invitation to all who want/can attend. If there is a lot more interest I can find a bigger room or see if we can host another smaller event. We hosted the first one on a Friday and this one is on a Wednesday to accommodate those that cannot make it on Fridays. The slides and follow up materials will be available in Slack HPC channel and on the HPC blog after the meeting.

*Feel free to forward to other faculty and students.

This is a placeholder for the second “Research Computing Office Hours”.

We (ITS) will try to host one about every month, around lunchtime, preferably on days where it does not compete with other happenings, to make sure faculty (and students) can attend.

The room is reserved for March 21 (Wednesday). It is the Classroom in the Cowart building.

The food from Pomona Catering is ordered.

The agenda is tentative and will likely be updated as I get more input from people. Please feel free to send your questions and thoughts and I will incorporate, time permitting (or address in another format).

1.	Review Research Computing (HPC) communications channels for those that missed it (5 min)
2.	An update on hardware and software ordering and architecture discussion. GPUs, anyone? (20 minutes)
3.	Other research institutions that use HPC and GPUs. Examples. Pomona ideas. (20 minutes)
4.	A deep dive into git, GitHub, GitHub Classroom and DevOps. (20 minutes)
5.	Discussion (Q&A) (~20 minutes)
