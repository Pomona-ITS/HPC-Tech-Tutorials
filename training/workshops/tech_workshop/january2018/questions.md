# Questions and Follow Up

1) ##  Q: What is the difference between a CPU and a node? What is a core?

   ##  A: A node is a physical server (or in some cases a VM (Virtual Machine), which will have an OS and will be used for running specialized student workloads, compute/batch jobs or interactive access. A CPU can also be called a processor or a socket (a socket is a place on a motherboard that a CPU is plugged into). A physical/bare metal node or server can have 2/4/8 sockets. A CPU can have up to 32/28 physical cores (AMD/Intel) or 64/56 virtual cores (with hyper-threading).

2) ## Q: What technology is MongoDB? What is NOSQL? How is it different from Object Storage?

3) Biology software and physical/virtual cores. Hyper-threading - good or bad? How many cores to use?

5) Thin provisioning in storage

6) Will we use Fiber Channel?

7) Can faculty compete in a student competition?

8) XSEDE and moving large datasets - what is the process?

9) Object storage - examples and use cases

10) Does the storage have to be geo-distributed? Multiple data centers?
