# Questions and Follow Up

## 1) What is the difference between a CPU and a node? What is a core?

  ### A node is a physical server (or in some cases a VM (Virtual Machine), which will have an OS and will be used for running specialized student workloads/Docker, compute/batch jobs or interactive access. A CPU can also be called a processor or a socket (a socket is a place on a motherboard that a CPU is plugged into). A physical/bare metal node or server can have 2/4/8 sockets. A CPU can have up to 32/28 physical cores (AMD/Intel) or 64/56 virtual cores (with hyper-threading).

## 2) What technology is MongoDB? What is NOSQL? How is it different from Object Storage?

  ### MongoDB calls itself a database but it is commonly known as NOSQL and it was created in 2007 to address the shortcomings or RDMBSs or Relational Databases. More information about the timeline and the company [here](https://www.mongodb.com/company).


3) Biology software and physical/virtual cores. Hyper-threading - good or bad? How many cores to use? 

4) Are the VMs "fixed"? Can you grow them on demand?

5) Thin provisioning in storage

6) Will we use Fiber Channel?

7) Can faculty compete in a student competition?

8) XSEDE and moving large datasets - what is the process?

9) Object storage - examples and use cases

10) Does the storage have to be geo-distributed? Multiple data centers?
