# This is the text that was included in the calendar invite:

Update: Slack URL for general announcements and questions: https://pomonaits.slack.com/messages/C8DTZN5GW

Note: Please forward to all that you think should attend (or let me know – and I will include them). So far, I included everyone who I have talked to about this initiative, and I am relying on you to extend the invitation to all who want/can attend. Just keep in mind that the room capacity is ~25. There are 22 people already on this invitation. If there is a lot more interest I can find a bigger room or see if we can host another event in February. If you cannot attend on Friday the 2nd but have an interest in another date (or a smaller meeting) – let me know. The slides and follow up materials will be available on the HPC blog after the meeting.


Hello All,

This is a placeholder for the first “Technology Workshop” aka “Research Computing Office Hours”.

We (ITS) will try to host one about every month, around lunchtime, preferably on days where it does not compete with other happenings, to make sure faculty (and students) can attend.

The room is reserved for February 2nd (Friday). It is the Classroom in the Cowart building.

Some sort of food will be available. I am open to suggestions.

The agenda is tentative and will likely be updated as I get more input from people. Please feel free to send your questions and thoughts and I will incorporate, time permitting (or address in another format).

1.	Research Computing (HPC) communications channels (5 min)
2.	Stakeholder Interviews - Summary (10 min)
3.	HPC Infrastructure Design (20 min)
4.	Use Cases and Partnering (10 min)
5.	HPC (Highly Parallel or Performing Computing) – Terminology and Technologies involved (30 min)
6.	Next steps (10 min)
7.	Discussion (Q&A) (~20 min)
