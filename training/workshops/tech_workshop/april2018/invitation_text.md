**ATTENTION**: We had a lower than hoped for attendance due to a conflicting faculty event that was scheduled just a few days prior. When things like that happen I don’t mind rescheduling, I just need to know about it. Also – If I am spamming you and you don’t want to be invited – please let me know. The people that did attend were telling me the content was useful so I am attaching the link to the slides at the bottom (please let me know if you want me to review them with you). Specifically, GitHub Classroom material – I think it is applicable to most of the faculty and can greatly simplify your process. I can also schedule another session sooner than April 24th if there is interest. There are also ideas about making sessions alternate between ITS-focused and Faculty-focused. Any feedback on this is welcome.

If you respond indicating that you are attending on April 24th I will have a special surprise for each of those that responded ☺
1. Topics:
Brief update on the status of hardware ordering
History of HPC (for William, if he attends)
DevOps, Configuration Management, Infrastructure as Code, Ansible, Puppet (with a guest presenter!), SaltStack, Chef, …. If there is time - SDN (Software Defined Networking), SecDevOps/DevSecOps, log management
Provisioning of Resources, Scalabilty, Virtualization, Hypervisors (ESXi, Xen, KVM), VirtualBox, Vagrant , Containers, Docker and its ecosystem, Unikernel, Singularity, Kubernetes, HashiCorp tools like TerraForm for migrating workloads between Desktop and HPC or a Cloud.
Hands on labs and step-by-step exercises to build your own environment, learn to collaborate, and build something together as a team. Suggestions for real life use cases are welcome.
I know that all this looks very ambitious – these are going to be introductory concepts and open to Q&A.

Please forward to all that you think should attend or let me know and will include them. So far, I included everyone who I have talked to about this initiative, and I am relying on you to extend the invitation to all who want/can attend. If there is a lot more interest I can find a bigger room or see if we can host another smaller event. We hosted the first one on a Friday and the second one on a Wednesday to accommodate those that cannot make it on Fridays. Now I am going to attempt an end of the day time slot! The slides and follow up materials will be available in Slack HPC channel and on the HPC blog/Box after the meeting. I am also experimenting with recording these to have audio, let me know if you are interested in the audio/video format.

This is a placeholder for the third “Research Computing Office Hours”.

We (ITS) will try to host one about every month, preferably on days where it does not compete with other happenings, to make sure faculty (and students) can attend.

The agenda is tentative and will likely be updated as I get more input from people. Please feel free to send your questions and thoughts and I will incorporate, time permitting (or address in another format).
