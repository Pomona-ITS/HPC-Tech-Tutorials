# This page is for organizing Technology Workshops

## The idea

With the HPC, DevOps and Cloud concepts crowding the already busy landscape maybe an informal meetup with the
freeform discussion of the concepts is in order. I will provide some guidance as to the order of discovery and
links, brief descriptions, learning materials, and pointers to free and relatively inexpensive courses, mostly online.

Then we will get together at the end of every month to discuss the plans, the progress, and the technical details
when appropriate.

This is not meant as a replacement for formal training which will be needed in some cases.

This is initially meant for ITS staff but we can invite Faculty and eventually even students that want to learn more.

### Technology Workshop #1: Topics

#### HPC (Cluster Management Tools like Bright Computing, Schedulers and Job Managers like Grid Engine and Slurm, 
Paralell File Systems, Data Transfer Nodes and tools like Globus and Aspera, Science DMZ, Cloud Bursting, scratch storage, 
coprocessors, GPUs, Intel Phi, socket vs CPU vs physcial core vs virtual core, Optane and more)

#### DevOps (Configuration Management, Infrastructure as Code, Puppet, Ansible, Salt, Chef, Containers, Docker, Singularity, 
GitHub, git and more)

#### Cloud (AWS, GCE, Azure, EC2, S3, EBS, CloudTrail)

### Topics for future workshops

- HPC software and HPC software management
- Object Storage
- K8s (Kubernetes)
- SDN (Software Defined Nertworking)
- Logging and Alerting (ELK stack, other similar tools, integrations, e.g. PagerDuty)
- AR/VR/MR (Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, Mixed Reality)
- AI/ML/DL (Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning)
