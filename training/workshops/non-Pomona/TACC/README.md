# TACC is Texas Advanced Computing Center based in Austin, TX

It has a number of SuperComputers including [Stampede2](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/systems/stampede2)

Stampede2 is the flagship supercomputer at The University of Texas at Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). 
A strategic national resource, Stampede2 provides high-performance computing capabilities to thousands of researchers 
across the U.S. It entered full production in Fall 2017 as an 18 petaflop system that builds on the successes of the original 
Stampede cluster it replaced. Stampede2 features 4,200 Knights Landing (KNL) nodes — the second generation of processors 
based on Intel's Many Integrated Core (MIC) architecture —and 1,736 Intel Xeon Skylake nodes.

TACC is actively involved in HPC education via numerous workshops, most of them very inexpensive.

The slide deck describing the current and near future workshops (most are $500) is here.
