The National Computational Science Institute is offering a five-day summer workshop entitled 
Computational Chemistry for Chemistry Educators. The workshop will begin 10 AM Monday, June 18 
and will finish by noon on Friday, June 22. This workshop emphasizes hands-on molecular modeling 
and other web-based and commercial software important for incorporating computational chemistry 
into the undergraduate curriculum.  No previous experience with molecular modeling is required. 
A list of topics includes:

*Introduction to Computational Chemistry 
*Choice of Theoretical Method 
*Electron Density, Electrostatic Potential, and Reactivity Predictions 
*Computing Vibrational Frequencies and Thermochemical Properties 
*Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) 
*Systems Dynamics/Chemical Kinetics 
*Basis Sets 
*Single Point Energies and Geometry Optimizations 
*Modeling in Solution
*Computing UV-Vis and NMR Spectra
*Transition States
