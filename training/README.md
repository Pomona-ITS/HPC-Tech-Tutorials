# This page is for summarizing the training options available immediately or being worked on

## Technology Workshops

This is something we can start doing right away to get everyone on the same page as to why we are doing what we are doing,
how we are doing it, and when we are doing it. There will be other methods of communication, a lot of them more frequent.
This is meant for the general audience that is not necessarily directly involved but curious, and an interface to Faculty
and Students eventually.
