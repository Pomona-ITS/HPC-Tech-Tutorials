# This page is for documenting the Gaussian Upgrades project

History:


From Dan O'Leary:

```
Hi Steven and Asya,
 
Our Gaussian software is purchased by HMC and we have a 5C license for installation on research computers (linux and windows have been the typical installs). Asya has implemented the linux code on machines, and Iâ€™d like to upgrade our windows lab computers (and faculty computers, like mineJ)
 
Steven, do you have access to Gaussview6 and Gaussian 16 install files? If not, can you work with Asya to track them down and begin a windows upgrade?
 
Thanks,
 
Dan
```

To Do:

- Download Windows versions of Gaussian 16 and the GaussView 6
- Find out how many (which) systems need to be upgraded (and which users need to verify they work to their satisfaction)
- Test on one system (with end user involvement)
