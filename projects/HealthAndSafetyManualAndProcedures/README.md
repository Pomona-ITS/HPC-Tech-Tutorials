# This is a placeholder for the project of creating an SOP, Manual, FAQ and any other necessary materials for the 3dPrinting room.

The template: https://ehs.ucr.edu/laboratory/3d_printing_sop.html

Lindsey is reviewing the template and will upload a draft of the Pomona-specific document.

Lindsey can get David, Jack, Chris involved (or just send a Slack message to the channel to request help).

First draft: [Word](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/projects/3D%20Printing%20Health.docx) and [PDF](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/projects/3D%20Printing%20Health.pdf).
