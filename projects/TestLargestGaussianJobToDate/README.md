Hi Asya,
 
This may be the longest job that I ever ran—the output file is 42MB, so I won’t attach it. This calculation ran on 7 processors for several months at Bowdoin. You may want to adjust the Gaussian-defined values for:
 
%mem=14GB [I set this to 44GB for calculations on Urey]
Maxdisk=40GB [probably doesn’t need to be defined if the scratch space is nearly limitless]
%nproc=7 [adjust to the new system]
 
 
The Gaussian timing was as follows:
 
Job cpu time:356 days 22 hours  6 minutes 30.0 seconds.
File lengths (MBytes):  RWF=  27815 Int=      0 D2E=      0 Chk=     32 Scr=      1
Normal termination of Gaussian 03 at Wed Apr 22 23:12:52 2009.
