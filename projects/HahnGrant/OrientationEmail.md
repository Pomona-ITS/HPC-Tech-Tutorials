Hello HPC Supportians (like Martians, I guess, in terms of unexplored territory),
 
I am going to attempt to keep you updated on what is happening at the end of each week.
 
As a result of the school year start and the student job fair, I am still in the process of interviewing more people (looks like will be done with that today).
 
Reminder: if I am not available and you need a question answered, and I am not responsive, you can try asking Angelina, she will be able to answer your question or find someone who can. Or tell you to wait till I become available. She is CC’d. Always try to CC us both on important group things.
 
We have 22 applicants and 17 of you have been hired or are in the process. Everyone who is getting this email should have already sent their information to Angelina and been entered/is in the process of being entered into Workday/Kronos which you will use to track your time and get paid. Some of you are international students in the process of getting their SSN and that might take a little longer. I will be double-checking next week.
 
Those of you who are not done with the HR (Human Resources) process yet, cannot officially work. Only watch, and learn, and ask questions.
 
Hahn Grant (Teaching Through Technology) is through May 2019 when I am going to renew it. In the meantime I ask that you do not record the time you spent studying/learning about new HPC concepts as work. Only the actual work on a ticket/assigned project, and meetings. Our budget right now allows for about 20 students working 1-2 hours a week for 20 weeks. If something calls for more time, please let me know, we will discuss and determine the best course of action.
 
I have hopefully added you all to Slack which is our primary communications tool (with email as fallback). There are 3 channels. #hpc is for general announcements/ideas and is open to those outside of Pomona. #hpc-classroom is for those that attend the monthly Research Computing Office Hours (RCOH). The last one just happened (September 12) and the slides are available. I highly recommend that you go through the channel history and read up on what transpired so far. Do the Daily Challenges, it will help. #hpc-helpdesk is for discussing the actual tickets and communicating to the members of ITS that support HPC infrastructure. Those of you familiar with concepts are encouraged to share your knowledge with others in Slack. There is now an @hpcsupport group if you want to ping all students involved in HPC.
 
If you have not created a GitHub username yet, go ahead and do that. If you have one – send it to me, I will add you to our team with access to our documentation repository.
 
Availability Schedule. If you have not sent me your schedule yet please do so I have an idea on when I can bug you. I am looking at tools like Doodle and WhenIWork to have some sort of shared calendar (because doing this in Outlook seems very painful) but I have not decided on which one to use yet. Feedback is welcome. I will be inviting you to WhenIWork via email. (https://appx.wheniwork.com/scheduler)
 
Most of the time Fridays after 3 pm is Open House, meaning I am available, and hanging out in Project Room C ,  and looks like most of you are available at that time – that is our team meeting time, in Cowart building. If there are more than 5-6 people we will grab the main conference room. There will be a calendar invite (recurring) for this.
 
This Friday (today) at 4 pm is the 3d printer setup/documentation session. Those of you that can make it will be trained on how to use the printer and will help create documentation for ITS staff, other students, and potential collaborators.
 
Next Friday is VR (Virtual Reality) setup/documentation. Same deal. Train others, encourage ideas and exploration.
 
Fridays at 2 pm I have a weekly Blog Writing session. This one is mostly for me (discipline), but you are welcome to join as writing buddies. I am hoping that each of you will contribute to the blog that can be found via http://hpc.pomona.edu. By the way, the web site is still a work in progress. It is based on Drupal and if you are interested in helping out with updating the web site content let me know.
 
I am compiling a list of potential projects and I will be sharing them with you to figure out who wants to do what. Probably starting next week. If you see something that sounds interesting – let me know.
 
Once you got your bearings and are ready to  schedule a one on one with me to dive deeper into a topic, ask questions, or get assistance with your assigned project – let me know (date/time/how long).
 
If you have an interesting project during your classes that requires using our HPC infrastructure – let me know.
 
We will be experimenting with Anchor for podcasts so go ahead and download it/play with it – I will schedule a separate session to go over the details.
 
We will be experimenting with FlipGrid for video education. I will send out the Classroom link to that, share the password in person, and will schedule a separate session to discuss the logistics. I am hoping that each of you can record an intro in FlipGrid, talking about your interests and passions. Maybe spend some time organizing your thoughts for that.
 
I am probably forgetting something so if during your interview/orientation I said any other useful things please remind me so I can add to the orientation document I am working on.
 
Ask good questions. Document. Teach others.
