Hello HPC Supportians (like Martians, I guess, in terms of unexplored territory),
 
I am going to attempt to keep you updated on what is happening at the end of each week.
 
This is a summary of all the things every one of you needs to know. Please add if I missed anything.
 
Seeking Help: If I am not available and you need a question answered, and I am not responsive, and noone is responding on Slack, you can try asking Angelina (angelina.quevedo@pomona.edu), she will be able to answer your question or find someone who can. Or tell you to wait till I become available. Always try to CC us both on important group things if you are sending an email.
 
We had 23 applicants (!) and 20  have been hired or are in the process. Everyone who is reading this should have already sent their information to Angelina and been entered/is in the process of being entered into Workday/Kronos which you will use to track your time and get paid. Some of you are international students in the process of getting their SSN and that might take a little longer. I will be double-checking.
To learn more about Hahn Grant go [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/addf73d189aebe42c10adf60be1af8b06c1ca110/projects/HahnGrant/README.md)
 
Those of you who are not done with the HR (Human Resources) process yet, cannot officially work. Only watch, and learn, and ask questions.
 
Hahn Grant (Teaching Through Technology) is through May 2019 when I am going to try and renew it. In the meantime I ask that you do not record the time you spent studying/learning about new HPC concepts as work. Only the actual work on a ticket/assigned project, and meetings. Our budget right now allows for about 20 students working 1-2 hours a week for 20 weeks. If something calls for more time, please let me know, we will discuss and determine the best course of action.
 
I have hopefully added you all to Slack which is our primary communications tool (with email as fallback and for larger communications). Think you have a sentence or a paragraph? Slack. A page or more - email. A dissertation - Box. A project with To Dos: GitHub. There are 3 channels we use in Slack. #hpc is for general announcements/ideas and is open to those outside of Pomona so be careful discussing internal stuff. #hpc-classroom is for those that attend the monthly Research Computing Office Hours (RCOH). The last one just happened (September 12) and the slides are available. The next one is October 24. If you are not on the calendar invite - let me know. I highly recommend that you go through the channel history and read up on what transpired so far. Do the Daily Challenges, it will help. #hpc-helpdesk is for discussing the actual tickets and communicating to the members of ITS that support HPC infrastructure. Those of you familiar with concepts are encouraged to share your knowledge with others in Slack. Including particpation in Daily Challenges. There is now an @hpcsupport group in Slack if you want to ping all students involved in HPC.
 
If you have not created a GitHub username yet, go ahead and do that. If you have one – send it to me, I will add you to our team with access to our documentation repository.
 
Availability Schedule. If you have not updated your schedule yet please do, so I have an idea on when I can bug you. We use WhenIWork to have some sort of shared calendar (because doing this in Outlook seems very painful)  I invited you to WhenIWork via email. (https://appx.wheniwork.com/scheduler). Please enter both when you are unavailable and your preferred working hours.
 
Most of the time Fridays after 3 pm is Open House, meaning I am available, and hanging out in Project Room C, and looks like most of you are available at that time – that is our team meeting time, in Cowart building. If there are more than 5-6 people we will grab the main conference room. There will be a calendar invite (recurring) for this. Each time we will have a topic but we will also address anything outstanding as a team.
 
So far we had 3 meetings, 3DPrinting, VR, and Project Assignment. Those of you that did not attend those meetings but want to be  be trained on how to use the printer and VR - let me know and we will schedule some time for you to catch up. I hope you will help create documentation for ITS staff, other students, and potential collaborators. There are two additional repositories for VR and 3DPrinting. I am adding only those that had expressed interest.
 
When you learned something new please train others, encourage ideas and exploration.
 
Fridays at 2 pm I have a weekly Blog Writing session. This one is mostly for me (discipline), but you are welcome to join as writing buddies. I am hoping that each of you will contribute to the blog that can be found via http://hpc.pomona.edu. By the way, the web site is still a work in progress. It is based on Drupal and if you are interested in helping out with updating the web site content let me know. The blog is WordPress. If you have a research project that will result in using HPC and publishing a paper - even better.
 
I have compiled a list of potential projects in https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/tree/master/projects - let's review and  figure out who wants to do what.  If you see something that sounds interesting – let me know. If you need more details - let me know. If possible work in teams.
 
Once you got your bearings and are ready to  schedule a one on one with me to dive deeper into a topic, ask questions, or get assistance with your assigned project – let me know (date/time/how long). Ideally we will do this at least bi-weekly with each of you.
 
If you have an interesting project during your classes that requires using our HPC infrastructure – let me know. If someone in your class or a professor has an interesting project - bring them to our weekly meeting or schedule some time for us to discuss. There is a monthly RCAG (Research Computing Advisory Group) that is in charge of deciding which projects need HPC and how to facilitate. You or someone who is interested in influencing these decisions can join.
 
We will be experimenting with Anchor for podcasts so go ahead and download it/play with it – I will schedule a separate session to go over the details.
 
We will be experimenting with FlipGrid for video education. I shared the Classroom link to that in #hpc-helpdesk and here it is again: https://flipgrid.com/32c162, will share the password in person or ask one of the students. I am hoping that each of you can record an intro in FlipGrid, talking about your interests and passions. Maybe spend some time organizing your thoughts for that. Addy is leading the content creation part of this and will be scheduling some time with all of those that are interested in participating. We are attempting to create a video library of educational HPC content. POssibly to share with the world.

You are all now a part of Footprints - the ticketing system ITS uses. And should be getting tickets assigned to HPCSUpport group. If anything looks interesting, and you are available and IN KRONOS, and want to work on it, ping me on Slack. If you are working a ticket - post in hpc-helpdesk (when started and when done). And remember to update the Footprints ticket (and the user via email if necessary). Document what you do (a temporary text document is fine), then prettify and post in GitHub. If it turns into a beast of a project create a GitHub project, use Issues in GitHub. The difference between Footprints and GitHub: Footprints is for summaries (user/management facing). GitHub is for technical details (us). Box is for large files (link to GitHub).

If you are interested in attending conferences (in person or virtually), let's talk. A partial list is [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/tree/addf73d189aebe42c10adf60be1af8b06c1ca110/training/conferences). Most of them have student funding/scholarships. If you are presenting about Pomona we may be able to fund it as well.

Next Friday is THE TOUR OF THE DATA CENTER!
 
I am probably forgetting something so if during your interview/orientation I said any other useful things please remind me so I can add to this orientation document I am ALWAYS working on. Or just add them.

This is the Q&A I created based on the questions you contributed during the Student Job Fair:
 
Ask good questions. Document. Teach others.

To Figure out:

- badge access to ITS area (data center?)

- Develop the idea of a study group (topics like Python, Data Science, use MeetUp?)
