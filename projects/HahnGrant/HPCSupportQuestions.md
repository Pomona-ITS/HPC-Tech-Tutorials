# The questions about the HPC Support position from the September 5 2018 Student Job Fair:


1) Are the hours flexible?

Yes, We use WhenIWork to indicate when we are not available and when our preferred working hours are. But we are legally limited to 20 hours a week.

2) Who is in charge?

I am your main point of contact. If you can't find me and Slack/Email failed - Angelina Quevedo can help route you in the right direction. She is our Buisiness Manager and can help with a wide range of issues included but not limited to: HR, Payroll, Purchasing, Software Access, Org Chart... Also asking in #hpc-helpdesk Slack channel is visible to the majority of the ITS team.

3) What if I have no CS experience or skills?

Not a problem. I will inundate you with information. You will be running the CS department in no time.


4) What building do we meet in?

Cowart or outside or in a building where the customer/meeting is. Mainly Cowart. I will try to make the Conference Room available. It can accommodate 20+ people. The seconf best is the Classroom. And for smaller groups or VR/3DPrinting projects - Project Room C.


5) What if I am interested in something particular?

Slack me or schedule a One on One. Preferably, summarize what you want to meet about first so I can be prepared to answer your questions and be productive.


6) What are the hours?

Officially 8:30 to 5:30 (ish). I am usually in the office by 9 and stay at least till 6. Can stay longer if you need me to.
We don't typically work on weekends but if some of you can only be available on weekends we will discuss and make it work.
Also, I am a night owl so it is pretty typical for me to be reachable late.


7) Can I work remotely?

Absolutely. Most projects you can. When you become more comfortable with the job we will even look into getting you a VPN client. Yep.


8) Is there an orientation document?

This and the [Orientation Email](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/projects/HahnGrant/OrientationEmail.md).


9) How many people will be hired?

Right now our budget allows for about 20 people working 1-2 hours a week. The assumption is that not everyone will be working every week and hours are going to be different for everyone. Also, we may be able to work something out when the Hahn grant money runs out. I will be monitoring the spend and will update you.


10) How does publishing work?

You can write for the HPC Blog at https://research.pomona.edu/hpc/. 
If you mean publishing papers - schedule a One on One and let's talk. Also ask your teammates, some of them are already doing that. Or your advisor. You can also submit talks and papers to conferences.


11) What kind of projects can I work on?

Hopefully, something that suits your level of knowledge and skills but I will be challenging you. All the potential projects live here: https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/tree/master/projects. You will also be seeing Footprints tickets as they come in and can choose one of those. The first time you will shadow me or a more experienced teammate and when you become comfortable with doing work on your own we will promote you.


12) How does training work?

GitHub is the main source of (hopefully up to date) information. Slack channel history should be reviewed. Daily Challenges are useful. I am also looking into providing some sort of portable/mobile/online training. And finally, FlipGrid and Anchor.


13) What subgroups are there? VR, HPC, 3dPrinting, Cryptography?

Yes to all but Cryptography. If you want to create a Cryptorpahy group talk to Raequan. 


14) How do I collaborate with people in different departments?

You send them a nice informative email and see what happens. Attending department and project meetings is another way. Cafeteria. Stalking. This last one is a joke.


15) Can I do multiple projects?

You can certainly try but you have to give them equal amount of attention. And make progress. And document. And make sure your customer(s) is (are) happy.


16) What if I can't program?

You will learn. Resistance is futile.


17) What is the work environment like?

Fast-paced, full of puzzles and unscripted activities but frienfly and always ready to listen to any constructive feedback you have. Keyword being "construcctive".

18) Do I need to be a Computer Science/CS major?

Nope. In fact, we would love to have more Humanities majors.

19) How much learning do I do by myself?

As much as you like and feel comfortable with. Your college studies are always more important. And sleep.

20) How do we communicate?

Fast/Short - Slack, Longer - Email, Really Long - GitHub. When you reach GitHub's limit - Box (and tell GitHUb where you put stuff in Box). Also, verbally. D'uh.
