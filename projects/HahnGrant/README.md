# This is the page for tracking everything that has to do with the Hahn Grant "Teaching Through Technology"

The official description of what Hanhn grant is [here](https://www.pomona.edu/administration/academic-dean/funding/teaching-and-learning).

Mary and William had suggested I apply and I did. The submisison text is [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/projects/HahnGrant/ITS_HPC_Submission.md). 

It was approved and so far:

- I had acquired an external GPU (eGPU) which is documented [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/design/vendors/Sonnet/README.md)

- created a job posting in Handshake for an HPC Support position and interviewed 3 people and hired 2 of them so far, they are starting on June 13th

- the third candidate is not available till late August-September at which point I am hoping that candidate can start helping out with the documentation and project management side of things

- The Hahn grant is for a year (so till May of 2019); or if the money os spent!

- The HPC Setup project (details in LiquidMapper) and the research-related tickets are going to be the focus of the project

- Throughout the grant activities the students and other people involved are encouraged to document their experience via blog posts or notes in some other format which at the end wil be summarized and shared in some form. The goal is for the students to acquire new, HPC-related skills and assist in making technology more people-friendly.
