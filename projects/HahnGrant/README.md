# This is the page for tracking everything that has to do with the Hahn Grant "Teaching Through Technology"

The official Pomona description of what Hahn grant is [here](https://www.pomona.edu/administration/academic-dean/funding/teaching-and-learning).

Mary and William had suggested I apply and I did. The submisison text is [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/projects/HahnGrant/ITS_HPC_Submission.md). 

It was approved and so far:

- I had acquired an external GPU (eGPU) which is documented [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/design/vendors/Sonnet/README.md)

- created a job posting in Handshake for an HPC Support position and interviewed 3 people and hired 3 of them so far, they  started in June/July. 3 more joining in September. The job posting will remain there as it would be interesting to have people from different disciplines. So far 3 are from CS, one is Economics, one is Economics/Math and one is an English major!

- In late August-September I am hoping that the student workers can start helping out with the documentation and project management side of things.

- The Hahn grant is for a year (so till May of 2019); or if the money is spent!

- The HPC Setup project (details in LiquidMapper) and the research-related tickets are going to be the focus of the project

- Throughout the grant activities the students and other people involved are encouraged to document their experience via blog posts or notes in some other format (video: FlipGrid or podcast: Anchor) which at the end wil be summarized and shared in some form. The goal is for the students to acquire new, HPC-related skills and assist in making technology more people-friendly.
