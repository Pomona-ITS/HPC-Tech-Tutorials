# This is the page for tracking everything that has to do with the Hahn Grant "Teaching Through Technology"

The official description of what Hanhn grant is [here](https://www.pomona.edu/administration/academic-dean/funding/teaching-and-learning).

Mary and William had suggested I apply and I did. The submisison text is [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/projects/HahnGrant/ITS_HPC_Submission.md). 

It was approved and so far:

- I had acquired an external GPU (eGPU) which is documented here 

- created a job posting in Handshake for an HPC Support position and interviewed 3 people and hired 2 of them

- the third candidate is not available till late August-September at which point I am hoping that candidate can start helping out with the documentation and project management side of things

-
