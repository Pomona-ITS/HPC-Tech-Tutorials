hahn-description            
In the world of software and research computing, in general, there are multitudes of tools for measuring software performance.
There isn't a single definitive guide that summarizes performance results across a sampling of different architectures, 
old and new, different operating systems, configuration options, optimization techniques in a straightforward, 
user-friendly manner. Not an easy task but we should be trying to make all software run more efficiently.

In the process of designing, building and running the research infrastructure at Pomona College there will be a 
number of interesting use cases across at least 10 departments where we have an opportunity to optimize and speed up 
some of the software that is used today in teaching and research. There is an opportunity to answer questions like 
"Do I need more cores or faster cores?" "How much can I scale my software to be most efficient?" "What is most important 
for my software - CPU, RAM, IO?" This will be an ongoing project which can involve student workers who will help 
augment ITS in supporting the research infrastructure and learn very valuable IT skills that are transferable and 
useful in the world today. There are elements of data collection, processing, visualization, presentation, 
and this could be the foundation for creating a more formal (online?) course for software profiling/benchmarking.

1) student workers (1-2) for 160 hours at $10 (or whatever the legal required rate is) for $1600-$3200 
depending on the level of demand - supporting the research environment, with tickets, first level support, 
scripting, troubleshooting, data management 
 
2) an external GPU card for testing and writing parallelised/CUDA code - $2,000 (this may end up being 
counted towards #3 if V100s cannot be discounted 
 
3) additional 2 x V100 cards to populate the Microway server to full capacity of 4 cards - $5,000
