We are meeting today in the Cowart conference room at 3 pm to discuss ITS VR Lab. I will make this a topic of the discussion and we will respond in more detail next  week but as a minimum, I see ITS participating by:

 

1) Allowing access to the ITS VR / 3d printing lab when necessary

2) Supporting via ITS Staff and Student Workers (Hahn Grant) involvement when necessary

3) Bringing interesting vendors for talks and demos

4) Help write grants for more equipment / specific projects (like Magic Leap) and participate/support participation in conferences / blog

5) Help the communications cross the department/college borders (since we are sometimes involved in initiatives that may benefit from sharing)

6) I started a GitHub repo where we will record other ideas

Asya and I had a brief conversation a while ago about a hypothetical space for playing, streaming, and making games, 
and ITS’s possible roles in access, networking, and so on (of course, we didn’t commit to anything because it was all 
very preliminary). Well, I’ve been in talks with Jessica Greene at the library and things are getting less hypothetical: 
the library seems interested in augmenting the digital humanities tech room with sufficient resources and support to 
make it a proper games lab! Jessica had the following question which I want to open up to ITS: “What role could/would 
Pomona IT play in the gaming lab? I had a preliminary chat with The Claremont Colleges Services IT 
(our consortia parenting body who provide IT to us and now IT infrastructure to the 7colleges). 
They had some concerns about internet bandwidth and IT support of the technology. 
We are in the process of hiring a space and technology coordinator and I foresee this falling to that role. 
As for internet bandwidth, did Pomona IT raise any concerns? If so, perhaps we can consult with them before 
I send the proposal forward?” Should Jessica and I meet up with someone from ITs to discuss the nature of our needs 
and whether/to what extent ITS would like to be involved? Thanks!
