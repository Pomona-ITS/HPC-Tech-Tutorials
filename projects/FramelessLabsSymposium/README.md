Subject: Fwd: [GAMESNETWORK] CFP: Frameless Symposium AR/VR/MR
 
As the main folks I know interested in AR/VR, I thought Iâ€™d pass along an opportunity for virtual conference talks run by a solid group at RIT, where I did my undergrad.  It could be a good target for independent studies or other work.

This is the first year that RIT's Frameless Symposium is open to researchers and practitioners outside of RIT.

 

We are accepting abstracts for short talks or demos involving XR. Talk abstracts will be double blind peer review and demos will be reviewed by a jury. We are looking for submission of completed projects, work in progress and student submissions.

 

The festival is free and for those far away from Western NY, virtual talks are encouraged.

 

Call for Participation

Frameless Labs is a faculty led partnership at RIT that brings together research, innovation, and artistic creations surrounding XR (VR/AR/MR) mediums and is housed under the umbrella of the MAGIC Center.

This free annual symposium is an interdisciplinary gathering that combines technology-focused approaches with humanities-inspired theoretical inquiry, empirical research and artistic expression. Additionally, the symposium aims to create a rich environment for academic-industry partnerships in the technological development and application of VR, AR and MR technologies.

The Frameless Symposium invites contributions from both industry and academia related to XR for:

XR tech demos, games, art and experiences. Projects may be completed, prototypes or still in development.
short talks (20minutes) describing ongoing or completed research
