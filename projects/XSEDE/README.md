# This page is for documenting the activities related to [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/)


"XSEDE is a single virtual system that scientists can use to interactively share computing resources, data and expertise. People around the world use these resources and services — things like supercomputers, collections of data and new tools — to improve our planet."


The [letter](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/projects/XSEDE/Pomona%20College%20Champion%20Signed.pdf) designating Asya Shklyar as the champion was signed September 18 2018.


Joined two mailing lists: campuschampions and region02champions


and the Slack channel: campuschampions.slack.com.


XSEDE is not the only "scientific cloud". There are others like [Aristotle Cloud Federation ](https://www.cac.cornell.edu/about/news/aristotle.aspx), [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/) and the [European EGI](https://www.egi.eu/). More about Aristotle Cloud [here](https://federatedcloud.org).

## One of the "duties" of an XSEDE champion is attending the monthly call

The slides from the latest call are [here](https://colbrydi.github.io/cyberambassadors/images/20180917-CC-CyberAmbassador-intro.pdf). The focus was on communication skills when working with our customers - researchers.
