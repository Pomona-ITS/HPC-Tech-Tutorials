# This page is for documenting the activities related to [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/)


"XSEDE is a single virtual system that scientists can use to interactively share computing resources, data and expertise. People around the world use these resources and services — things like supercomputers, collections of data and new tools — to improve our planet."
