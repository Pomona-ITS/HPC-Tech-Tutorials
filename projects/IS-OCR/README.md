# This is the page for documenting the progress of the POC project with Nick Wheatley using Google Tesseract (OCR tool) to process scanned files into text.

There is a separate [repo](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/IS-OCR) for the project files. It uses Docker for portability. It also uses Python.

This is a [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/9378c91c-b004-41c6-b03d-3ca1d0a25ccc) of our brainstorm of the steps involved.
