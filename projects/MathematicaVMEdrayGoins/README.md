# This is a project I have discussed wuth professor [Edray Goins](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/edray-goins)

The VM is already provisioned (CentOS 7). Need to install Mathematica and make sure it works for him.

Future deveopments will include scaling up to HPC.

Need to schedule another meeting eith him because I talked to him when he just joined Pomona and he had a lot on his plate.
