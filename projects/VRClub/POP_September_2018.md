Subject: Virtual Reality Club Workshop Tomorrow, September 22!
 
Hello Virtual Reality Club, 

Thank you so much for agreeing to host a workshop for our POP weekends!  

Your workshop will be held in Lincoln Hall - 1135 from 7-8: 30 PM, tomorrow Saturday, September 22. During this time Groove Nation will also be holding a workshop and there will also be a FLI event, so do not expect an overwhelming turnout. We expect students will attend the FLI event first so expect them to arrive between 7:20 and 7:30. You’re welcome to do homework or anything else until they arrive. 

You should arrive around 6:45, or however early you’ll need to set up.  If you arrive and the rooms are locked please call facilities at (909) 621-8300 and let them know that these rooms were reserved by the Admissions Office for the purpose of club workshops. 

During your workshop be sure to explain: 
What your club is/what your club does
What it’s like to be in a club 
The variety of club options available at Pomona

From there you should lead into an interactive demonstration of your club’s work, similar to what you would do with new/potential members. This part shouldn’t be lecturey! Have fun with it! 

If you have any questions regarding this workshop please contact Carolyn Starks in the Admissions Office at carolyn.starks@pomona.edu. 

Best, 

Pomona College Access Team
