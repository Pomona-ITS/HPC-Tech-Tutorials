# This is the page for tracking the progress on the work for Joe Osborne in CS (AI course)

https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jcosborn/

Asya To Do:

- add Joe to Slack HPC channel


- add Joe to ITS GitHub repo


- verify that Slurm has functionality similar to HTCondor


- Send the link to the Handshake job posting


- Send the Hahn grant link


- Add to the calendar invite for next Research Computing Office Hours; could be an invited speaker at the next one (DGX, AI, workflow)


Discussed:

- Collaborators at UC Santa Cruz and Cal Poly


- Familiar with HTCondor (specifically interested in automatically moving files pre- and post- job execution); not familiar with Slurm. It is possible to use scripting in Slurm or use both schedulers.


- Contact at USC that can potentially help faciliate a VR Lab visit


- Familiar with Jupyter Hub, would definitely use it if available


- Use Singularity


- Suggestion to loop library in (VR efforts)


- Interested in having students use the HPC environment
