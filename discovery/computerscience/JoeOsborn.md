# This is the page for tracking the progress on the work for Joe Osborne in CS (AI course)

https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jcosborn/

Asya To Do:

- add Joe to Slack HPC channel - done!


- add Joe to ITS GitHub repo - done!


- verify that Slurm has functionality similar to HTCondor


- Send the link to the Handshake job posting


- Send the Hahn grant link - done!


- Add to the calendar invite for next Research Computing Office Hours; could be an invited speaker at the next one (DGX, AI, workflow)


- Info on account management in a game (or a VR) lab


Discussed:

- Collaborators at UC Santa Cruz and Cal Poly


- Familiar with HTCondor (specifically interested in automatically moving files pre- and post- job execution); not familiar with Slurm. It is possible to use scripting in Slurm or use both schedulers.


- Contact at USC that can potentially help faciliate a VR Lab visit


- Familiar with Jupyter Hub, would definitely use it if available


- Use Singularity


- Suggestion to loop library in (VR efforts)


- Interested in having students use the HPC environment


- [Expressive Intelligence Studio at UC Santa Cruz](https://games.soe.ucsc.edu/eis)


- Interested in building a game lab for playing and making games; will be acquiring consoles, will need assistance with the MAC address registration; interested in streaming (Open CourseWare, first CS, then Pomona, then 5c/7c then outside); Mary had mentioned the library and the tools [OneButtonStudio](https://onebutton.psu.edu/) and [Omeka](https://omeka.org/). Would need a green screen setup. DRM/Account - need to sort that out.


- A colleague (Kevin?) has an interest in VR (point of view)
