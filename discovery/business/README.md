# This page is for documenting the effort to speed up annuity modeling using GPUs

Cole suggested we discuss the possibilities.

Forwarded the materials with the details of usign R, helped install RStudio, and R. ~100 time speedup even before GPUs. Have the code, need to spend some time tweaking it for the GPUs.

Web Interface (Shiny) - Andrew's group, need to follow up.

Invited to Research Computing Office Hours.
