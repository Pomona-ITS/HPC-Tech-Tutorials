# This is for information about Scripps interest in Research Computing Infrastructure

From Jeanine Finn:

"Michael Spezio (http://www.scrippscollege.edu/academics/faculty/profile/michael-spezio) is a neuroscience prof 
who I’ve talked about computing support before. I referred him to Jeho and the XSEDE program in the fall – but 
I’m not sure if that was suitable for him."

Judging from the research interests VR/AR could be a great thing to explore, as well.

Jeanine will email-introduce.
