# This page is for information about Scripps interest in Research Computing Infrastructure

From Jeanine Finn:

"Michael Spezio (http://www.scrippscollege.edu/academics/faculty/profile/michael-spezio) is a neuroscience prof 
who I’ve talked about computing support before. I referred him to Jeho and the XSEDE program in the fall – but 
I’m not sure if that was suitable for him."

Judging from the research interests VR/AR could be a great thing to explore, as well.

Hi Jeanine and Asya,

Thank you so much for reaching out.

Yes, I would be interested to talk with you about HPC resources. I primarily use Matlab, python, and/or R (for Bayesian modeling using Stan), in applications of machine learning, network science, neural models, and cognitive models. So if any of those are of interest to Pomona HPC faculty it would be great to talk about grant opportunities that involve multiple projects or other forms of collaboration.

Please let me know if you'd like to meet sometime after Spring Break.

Best wishes,

Michael
