## Gaussian

http://gaussian.com/products/

Gaussian is a commercial software used in the Chemistry department at Pomona to teach Computational Chemistry and conduct research.
The site license was acquired by Claremont consortium (?) and is available to all 5cs with unlimited seats (?)

The version that is currently used at Pomona is Gaussian 09 and GaussView 5 (visualization software).

The latest version is Gaussian 12 and GaussView 6.

The following is an abstraction for the software management as it is right now:

1) Manage vendor relationship (CUC? HMC?)

  a) purchase new
  b) renew/support
  
2) Manage licenses (HMC, Robert Kingston)

  a) issue one time static code
  b) host a network license server that "gives out" licenses to users temporarily while they use the software aka "tokens"
  
3) Manage software distribution

  a) Download new/latest version/patch (HMC)
  b) Test new/latest version/patch (Pomona ITS/Chemistry/Maduka?)
  c) provision to production (Pomona ITS)
  
4) Manage User Support

  a) Level 1/2/3 (ITS/Asya/Todd)
