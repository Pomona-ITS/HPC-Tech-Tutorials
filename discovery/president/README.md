President Starr's research data will arrive from NYU on Thursday December 21 in an external hard drive, with a backup hard drive mirror. The data is encrypted to current Mac standards so it needs High Sierra to read.

 

The data will need to be stored locally. Access to the storage will be granted to Gabi, several of her non-Pomona research colleagues, and Pomona ITS staff (Pat, Asya, Todd). Depending on how the access is set up, non-Pomona staff may need sponsored accounts.

 

Also, Gabi's research colleague, Ed Vessel who works in Germany, will need a machine/workstation here at Pomona he could remote into to avoid the lag in data IO. The software used are Matlab and Freesurfer:

 

Summary of Requirements:
 Operating System: Linux, macOS
 Processor Speed: 2GHz at least
 RAM: 8GB recommended
 Graphics card: 3D graphics card with its own graphics memory & accelerated OpenGL drivers
 Size of installation package: 10GB
 Typical size of a processed subject: 300MB
Other requirements: Matlab (only needed to run FS-FAST, the fMRI analysis stream)

 

I assume this would have to be a Mac workstation to accommodate the requirements.
