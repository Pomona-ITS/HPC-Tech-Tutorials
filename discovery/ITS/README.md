1. AD, integration, user-creation

   Pat is in charge of AD. AD is Pomona only, no trusted relationships with any other ADs (HM has their own).
   When external users need an account on a Pomona Linux system they fill out a form (and are added to Pomona AD?).
   
   Currently the only server using the AD integration is RStudio. PAM/oddjob is used for auto-creation of user directories.
   The current list of users is here.
   All Pomona AD users have access to RStudio by default.

   b) Windows Unix Services?
