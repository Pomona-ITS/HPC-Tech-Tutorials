This is the place for all the Economics department-related discovery information.

[Kyle Wilson](https://www.pomona.edu/directory/people/kyle-wilson) has a single workstation 
with 12 physical and 24 virtual cores and 256 GB of RAM. He primarily runs R and RStudio
and his current physical workstation satisifies the requirements. He also had requested a VM with the
parameters described in the ticket 72782 in Footprints (12-24 cores, 64 GB RAM, 100 GB storage).

He also still has access to University of Arizona  HPC. His typical workload there was 250 cores spread across multiple
nodes using MPI. It was less than ideal as the process is iterative and informs subsequent steps.
Although RAM is important core count is essential.
