# This is a page for discovery in mathematics

So far met with:

Jo Hardin
Edray Herber Goins


Pribably need to reach out to Ghassan.

## Jo Hardin

Jo is mainly concerned about RStudio (web-based stability) for classroom. Will consider using HPC when ready.

## Edray Herber Goins

Edray wants to model pitch trajectories and will use the latest version of Mathematica.
We are provisioning a VM for him and will help parallelize code for HPC, use GPUs etc
16 cores / 32 GB / 500 GB
Wolfram Mathematica

He is only familiar with PBS, so will have to give a Slurm crash course.
Added to Slack. Need to add to GitHub.

Building a large database, most likely relational but may be able to use MongoDB. Maybe even a GraphDB.
10 fields. Millions of entries. Needs to be searchable.

Have parallelizable code.

This is a project for 3-4 years.

Generate a pitch on the fly.
