## May 2018

Richard Lewis had forwarded a copy of his [grant](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/discovery/psychology/Sontag%20grant%202018.pdf)!

The [prospective memory paper](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/discovery/psychology/JBBS_2017062115082139.pdf) that was used for inspiring this.

## March and April 2018

- Todd and Asya met with Richard Lewis on March 8th

- Thursdays noon self-study

- 3 dimensional brain disections

- Working with Keck sometimes (vendors)

- EEG - hundreds of electrodes, keywords, traces

- Near-infrared spectroscopy (cheaper than fMRI but more difficult)

- cortex

- synchronization of signals/between multiple people

- student in graduate school (UCLA) - a resource

The slides from the April 12 Faculty Meeting: [PowerPoint](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/discovery/psychology/Computing%20and%20Psychology.pptx) or [PDF](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/discovery/psychology/Computing%20and%20Psychology.pdf)

Of Note:

- Slow network when teaching (likely wireless, known issue, will get fixed with Cisco)
- Matlab local (non-networked licenses); Todd will assist
- Atlas.Ti interest
- M+ interest
- Communications and level of support clarifications
- Definite interest in HPC
- Possibly building a VR Lab over the summer
- A trip to another VR lab - UC Irvine, USC, UC San Diego, UC Davis, Stanford, Berkely, others? A google form with a questionnaire in the works.
- Todd had discovered that [Ori Amir](https://oriamir.com/) is a comedian studying the neuroscience of Humor!

Follow up from Richard:


Dear Todd and Asya,

Thank you for visiting our department and getting us excited about research possibilities.

I have spoken with my colleague, Sharon Goto, and we are interested in giving fNIRS a try once again.  Part of the difficulty in the past is the lack of support from TechEn, the producer of our fNIRS machine.  In truth, they are wonderful to work with it is just that they are not set up for heavy customer support.  They produce one of, if not the bet, fNIRS machines but tend to sell to institutions with a lot of technical support.  

One of our goals is to do hyperscanning experiments, given our interest in sociocultural neuroscience.  We had some initial success, which Todd may recall helping us out with.  One of our graduates is now in a Ph.D. program at  UCLA where she is doing such experiments and we plan to bring her out in early summer to give a talk to us about her work and she can serve as a consultant for us.

In any event, I thought a good place to start would be by replicating the attached experiment.  Early in my career I was interested in prospective memory (remembering to do intended actions) and this VR/propsoective memory experiment would be of great interest in setting up a VR system which could be used on our future sociocultural neuroscience experiments.  I am going to begin pursuing funding options (I am thinking about 10k initially).  I will write to TechEn to try and find out what i will need to update fNIRS machine.  

What should I budget for a good VR system?  And, how difficult (time/money) is it to program VR stimuli?

Thanks!!

richard
