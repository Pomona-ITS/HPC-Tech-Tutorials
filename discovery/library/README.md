I will look forward to discussing how we might work together on various academic programs and initiatives.  
I’d like to assemble a group to meet with you that includes library reps, the OCAC Director, and members of the 
Mellon DH award team.  By way of this message, I’m asking Barbara to check on your availability during the coming 
weeks when we might get together.
