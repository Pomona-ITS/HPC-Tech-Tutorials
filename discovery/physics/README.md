Scheduling a discussion about OpenFOAM migration from Fluent and GPUs.

History:

Hi Asya and Todd,
 
  Thank you so much for your presentation to the physics department about the initiative to support HPC at the College.  As I think I think I shared when we met I do CFD in my lab and currently have licenses of Fluent running on a computer in the Millikan basement.  I am interested in learning how we might incorporate this research with your more powerful computers.  I am also thinking that I would like to dedicate time this summer to transitioning our work to OpenFOAM to avoid the steam licensing fees from ANSYS.  Our Fluent license is good through the summer and I am worried that the learning curve for OpenFOAM might be too steep to climb for my students and me, but was hoping to dedicate a SURP project to this idea to see what this looks like.  Could we arrange a time to talk about my applications and see if this is something that makes sense for your new initiative?
 
Thanks,
Dwight
