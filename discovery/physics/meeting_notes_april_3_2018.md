## Premise:

- They use ANSYS

- They currently pay about $1400 a year (and would like not to or find a more reliable way to renew)

- Interested in switching to OpenFOAM and using it more (because free and open source) but no internal expertise; 
there is online training ($1,400)

- Larger models necessary

- Transient 

- HHMO last summer used money yo buy an I9 with 12 cores

- GPUs don’t help accordin gto ANSYS (?), the code doesn’t parallelize (check, asked to share the code)

- Factor of 10 improvement with the new computer, so happy but definitely could use more resources

- It takes one day to run now (from a week in the past)

- Good but happy to use more

- Wan to change parameters, run it,  walk away

- License till next October 

- Not sure where to get support with OpenFoam

- KGI biofluidics - has licenses - Offered to share

- MUDD has a license

- Maybe makes sense to participate in a Consortium-wide discussion on bulk licenses for ANSYS and central license management (has to be stable)

- Data Sharing needs to be solved

- Outputs are gigantic velocity and pressure grids

- Ascii to be analyzed by MATLAB, does not make sense, can we spit it out in MATLAB format? Text array to a number array does not work

- License server is downstairs; Hurtado and Kershaw set it up - can move - virtualize?

- Regularly scheduled meetings with the research group would be nice (once a week)

- May 22 start of the summer research

- Meetup with ANSYS Openfoam people?

- Modeling a biological system 

- PhysicsFluids Slack channel

- Dwight willl send the list of graduate students
