Met with Marc on January 29 to introduce myself and discuss the RStudio issues and ideas.

Topics:

- Students from other colleges are having trouble logging in to RStudio (Todd had mentioned using campus.pomobna.edu instead of pomona.edu but will have to test, especially CMC campus WiFi

- "privacy warning" - a certificate issue? (investigate with AISO?)

- One of the teaching topics is studying the climate in different parts of the world. Using GitHub integrated with RStudio for coursework/homework/data

- There is a new "classroom format in GitHub but no time to investigate (was not straightforward)

-
