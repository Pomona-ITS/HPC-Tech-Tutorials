# The list of Cisco slide decks 

## Cisco Tech Day in Irvine

1) Tetration

An East-West (before getting to router/firewall) packet header scanning C-based (fast, lightweight) installable agent, 
including physical hosts, VMs and containers, using process IDs, and machine learning to create example policies in JSON 
that can be applied right away (SELinux, iptables etc) on the host and/or converted to SourceFire and StealthWatch policies. 
This is SDN (Software Defined Networking). Super-integrated with HyperFlex. Licensing both per agent and yearly. 
Impressive visualization.
