The specifications for the DGX-1 are here.


DGX-1 is a rack-mountable solution. There is also a DGX - a workstation that could be used when the compute needs to be close 
to the researcher or an instrument.

Microway quote for DGX-1 is [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/design/vendors/Microway/MWYQ23280.pdf).

## The email from Samantha Wheeler, the technical sales contact:

Hello Ms. Shklyar,

Thank you very much for your request - my name is Samantha Wheeler, and I am happy to help provide as much information as I can.

The DGX-1 quotation is attached to the email and includes the Educational Discount. Please note that NVIDIA does require the purchase of either the one or three year support services with the DGX-1. This includes access to the container registry, system updates, support services through NVIDIA, as well as the hardware warranty. Many colleges and universities choose to purchase the three year service for the hardware warranty.

We do offer systems with Intel Xeon, AMD EPYC, and IBM Power processors. I think having a conversation might be best suited to identify what system characteristics you need in order to narrow it down.

You referenced a Supermicro system in your request below - would you prefer a single or dual socket configuration? If this is primarily to judge pricing, I can put together a standard 2U server configuration for both the Broadwell and Skylake generation for you to compare.

One thing I would like to bring to your attention is that Intel has dropped plans to further develop the Xeon Phi product line. If you have a need for using the current generation Xeon Phi "Knights Landing" there are a few systems available that we could review.

Please let me know if you have any questions on the DGX-1 quotation and if you would like the generalized quotes. I will be available Monday afternoon or Tuesday next week if you would like to have a discussion on the phone about the other platforms.

If I don't hear back from you, I hope you have a wonderful weekend!

Best Regards,
