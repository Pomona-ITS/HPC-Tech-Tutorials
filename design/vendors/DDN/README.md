# This page describes DDN technologies


Founded in 1998, DataDirect Networks (DDN) is a provider of large storage systems for unstructured data and big data 

environments. The company is headquartered in Santa Clara, California, USA, has about 650 employees,and in 2011 called 

itself the largest privately held information storage company.



DDN provides storage for applications such as cloud storage services, supercomputing, life sciences and genomics,

seismic processing, financial service trade and risk analysis, film production, live television broadcast, manufacturing, 

and video surveillance. 


I have designed, installed, and used two DDN storage systems, both GPFS/SpectrumScale, a 10XX, and a 12XX.

Now there is a 14KX and an EXAScaler for Deep Learning that was tested with DGX-based systems. This is meant as a Pure Storage competion.

The Datasheets and other useful info are all in this folder.
