https://www.corelight.com/ is the commerically supported version of https://www.bro.org/ - a network security monitor.

Bro has originally been developed by Vern Paxson, who continues to lead the project now jointly with a core team of 
researchers and developers at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, CA; 
and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications in Urbana-Champaign, IL.

While focusing on network security monitoring, Bro provides a comprehensive platform for more general network 
traffic analysis as well. Well grounded in more than 15 years of research, Bro has successfully bridged the traditional 
gap between academia and operations since its inception. Today, it is relied upon operationally in particular by many 
scientific environments for securing their cyberinfrastructure. Bro's user community includes major universities, 
research labs, supercomputing centers, and open-science communities.
