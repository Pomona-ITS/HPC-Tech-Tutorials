# This is the page for documenting Sonnet eGPU

This seems to be the Apple recommended and supported vendor for eGPUs. It should just work without any driver installation.

The history of eGPU exploration before I moved the page here (because it is no longer CUDA!) is in applications/CUDA.

So this is a Sonnet box with maximum power available (650 W) and an AMD Vega 64.

It did just work with a couple of gotchas:

- It is most stable when the power to the laptop is on the left side farthest form the user

- It is most stable when its Thundrbolt cable is plugged in next to the power (as opposed to the right side)

- It is most stable when the laptop power is going directly to the laptop, not through a hub/extension box

- It is pretty quiet

- I did have to assemble it, the card came separately (and had a propeller cover), the power cables for the card was difficult to plug into the enclosure.

- I acquired a 90 W adapter instaed of the default 60 W
