# This page is for documenting StarFish POC

This is a software solution to querying POSIX metadata.

This [White Paper](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/design/data_management/Starfish%20Whitepaper.pdf) explains it very comprehensively.

Had a call with the vendor, waiting for the VM setup and a quote for 30 TB.

Targeting primarily CS data discovery but can expand as necessary (pricing per TB).
