The first version of slides is [here](https://github.com/Pomona-ITS/hpc/blob/master/design/Pomona%20HPC%20Infrastructure%20Design.pdf)


The following were Cole's suggestions to incorporate in other versions of this slide deck*:

- Change Interviewed to "6 out of 10" and list the departments verbally (include n slide notes); 
similarly, shorten all the bullet points and separate slide from verbal description

- Nick Weber has the slides template for Pomona

- Group VMWare environment mentions

- Considerations: add the explicit mention of not designing HPC environment using the existing Enterprise environment

- Data Lake - move to Recommendations

- Add a mention of Dell/GPU Workstations; Pros and Cons' external GPUs as an option

- Make the mention of Home Directories explicitly Unix/HPC (not to be confused with Windows)

- Mention BeeGFS as the parallel file system to clarify the term (link to the comparison with GlusterFS)

- Pull out the NVIDIA GOU Cloud mention; differentiate between cloud bursting and grid-like resource sharing 
among liberal arts colleges; pointer to Mercury; mention Federation; shared FS; DTN; Internet2

- Pull out the CMU (Bright recommendation) and point to the reasoning

/* There will be be 2 more versions - one for William and his respective audiences and one for the public/conferences
