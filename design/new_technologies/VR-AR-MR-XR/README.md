## The initial email from Daziah:


Hi Prof. Andrejevic,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Daziah Turner and I am a rising second-year here at the College. I am writing to you on behalf of ITS's newest subgroup, HPC (High Performance Computing). I have CC'd Asya Shklyar, the Director of HPC, into this email as well. As a group, HPC supports research computing, performs projects, and collects data in addition to many other tasks. 

We are contacting you to inquire if you were available anytime soon to set up a meeting with us. There, we can formally introduce HPC and our goals as a unit. We wanted to form a relationship with you and the Pomona Virtual and Augmented Reality Club to discuss VR on campus, VR projects, and VR labs. This way we can enhance both the VR Club's presence on campus and HPC's usage and knowlege of VR technology.

Please let us know whenever you are available to set up a meeting. You can contact the ITS Help Desk via 909-621-8061 (ext. 18061) to reach me or ext. 79853 for Asya. Thank you for your time, and have a great rest of your day!

Best,
Daziah
