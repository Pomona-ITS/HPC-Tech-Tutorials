## VR/AR/MR (Virtual/Augmented/Mixed) reality

Why all the hype? The prices are coming down, the competition is growing, there are more developers and creatives and, therefore, a lot more content. It started out as an extension of video games and continues ot be driven by video games
but had been adoped in K12 and Higher Ed, Architectural Design, Travel and Tour Visualization, Campus Tours, Remote Social Interaction (World War II veterans meeting for anniversaries), Online COmmunites (Rec Room), Treatment of PTSD for the vetarans, Journalism, Movies, Immersive Art (Dali, Van Gogh), Interactive Experiences, Training (KFC), Simulations, Medicine, Empathy Training (Refugee experience, Autism, Sexual Assault Victims), and much more.

Below are some links that give you an idea of what was done so far. This list of far from extensive, mostly curated for Higher Ed, and if you find something that is not on it, please feel free to add. There are also a few definitive books on the subject, one of my favorites even uses AR (point your phone at the designated images and a cartoon of the author springs to life, with audio.

I found that it is easier to actually read a physcial book because it is harder to point your phone at the kindle or an iPad.
These kind of interesting experiential dilemmas can be discussed at length!

Virtual Reality means fully immersed in a headset (HMD or Head Mounted Display) like an Oculus Rift or an HTC Vive.

Augmented Reality is a combination of a head-mounted display or glasses with the actual real world, overlayed on top of it. Examples are Meta2, Microsoft HoloLens and many others. Or just you phone (Pokemon Go is one of the earlier examples).

Both technologies are "tethered" today if you are using an HMD because it requires a high speed connection like USB 3.0 or USB 2.0 and HDMI.

Many are working on untethering the devices and making them wireless and less expensive.

Another very interesting company that does not have a product yet (only for development, in limited quantities) is Magic Leap which does not have a bulky headset but rather a pair of stylish glasses. Another is Kopin, speciliazing in cyclists and runners.

Most tetherred setups use an area 0f 5x7 or 7x7 feet which technically requires a dedicted room without any furniture.

Most also use controllers that you have to use to operate within the virtual reality. There is a company called Leap Motion that has a camera (mounted on the front of the HMD) that can regonize hand gestures without any controllers but so far this is a work in progress.

There are also gloves from various manufacturers, and even full-body suits with sensors and haptic floors that create an illusion of a moving elevator or vibration of a factory floor or an explosion.

There are a lot of engines and SDKs (Software Development Kits) that aim to simplify the development in VR and AR and large communities with forums that make it easy to get started. Two of the most well-known engines are Unity and Unreal. These are free to a certain extent. They have marketplaces for plugins when you don't feel like writing your own. And characters. And scenes. You get the idea. There is an open source engine called Godot that is really powerful and is developing rapidly to compete.

Apple, the Android-based world and Google, and plenty of other companies like DAQRI (specilizing in Enterprise application for AR like construction sites and jet engine inspections) had released free SDKs for iPhone and Android-based phone development.

Some years ago Google had created the concept of a $10 Cardboard VR Viewer that makes it easy to explore the VR world without the investment in an expensive setup. It also allows for development and has a large community of educators that had already created massive amounts of 360 videos and immersive learning experiences. One can even download their cardboard layout and make the viewer with a couple of inexpensive lenses. Or order them in bulk, with branding, this is frequently used in sales and marketing.

There are now dozens of conferences on the subject including SXSW. Educause topics are increasingly about the use of VR/AR in educational settings. 

The setup at my desk includes an Oculus Rift, an HTC Vive, and a Meta2. I will keep them here for a few months so everyone can experience what VR has ot offer. I also have a Google Cardboard you can borrow if you want to see what it is like before acquiring one yourself.
