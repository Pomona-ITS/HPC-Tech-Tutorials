Michal Sofka is principal scientist at 4Catalyzer, where he works to revolutionize healthcare by designing deep neural networks for analyzing data from new types of sensors. Previously, he was a research scientist and project manager at Siemens Corporate Research, where he managed and directly contributed to research and development projects for various Siemens business units and external customers. Michal also was senior technical leader at Cisco, where he developed new algorithms in the area of large-scale traffic analysis for threat defense. He has published more than 30 technical articles in leading journals and conferences and more than 22 patent applications. Michal holds a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from Czech Technical University in Prague, a Master of Science in electrical engineering from Union College, and both a Master of Science and Ph.D. in computer science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
 
Session Description
We'll outline the challenges of training deep neural networks to segment, classify, and detect structures in medical images, and propose practical solutions for ultrasound image analysis. Unlike training neural networks on natural images, the difficulty in the medical domain is in accurately labeling the structures of interest in sufficient quantities, data variation caused by medical conditions, privacy and compliance issues, and correctly defining the requirements based on domain knowledge. We'll present how to train convolutional deep learning network architectures for accurate segmentation of structures in ultrasound images. We'll also show how to use the segmented structures, such as heart chambers, as reliable biomarkers to evaluate health outcomes.
